# Learning Unstructured

https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/

```bash
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"

## on a mac
brew install poppler
brew install tesseract
 
```


Learning in [learning notebook](learning.ipynb)


### notes

cleanup functions are a good pattern

it would be good to investigate the PDF type -> title vs narrative test detection

hi_res mode requires poppler and tesseract ... it is slow.  Not sure how much better it is for my docs
